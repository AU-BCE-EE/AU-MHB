TIC method for slurry samples
Updated: 31 MAR 2015 by SDH

0. (Weigh empty bottles--will be done at time of collection)
1. Weigh bottles with samples
2. Add 3 mol/L HCl (at least 2 mL of acid per 10 mL sample) (invert bottle when removing needle)
3. Shake vigorously for 30 seconds
4. Let the samples sit for 10 minutes
5. Shake again for 30 seconds
6. Let the samples sit for 10 minutes
7. Measure pressure with manometer
8. Record time of acid addition, time of pressure measurement, and air temperature

Notes:
If the sample is too dry, it is OK to add water before or after adding acid.
But, be sure to weigh the total mass before adding water.
The volume of water added should be included in the spreadsheet when entering the data.
