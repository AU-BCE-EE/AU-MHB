The simulations were done to assess the uncertainty related to a new measuring protocol for methane emissions from pig barns

The boundaries: 
Methane is measured from four farms over one year.
Methane is measured 8 times per barn, with two measurements per batch of pigs, one in the first and last part of each batch.
Four batches of pigs are produced per year.

The "control" section of the dataset from Dalby et al. 2023 was used as reference dataset. 
The dataset covers continuous methane emission data over four batches of finisher pigs. 

As four farms are needed the dataset was scaled to four randomly sampled emission factors from a litterature survey reported in Dalby et al. 2023   
During each campaign simulation four new emission factors were randomly sampled from the survey, thereby creating four new arbitrary farms. 
During each farm simulation the selected measuring weeks were randomly sampled in each phase and batch, following the boundaries described above. 
During each farm simulation emissions from partial and full measurement are reported and compared.

In total 1000 campaigns were simulated (4000 farms).
