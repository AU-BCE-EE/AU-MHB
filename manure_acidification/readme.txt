Directory is for analysis to go with 2020/2021 manure acidification report for the environment ministry.

A few notes to describe thinking behind analysis follow.

1. Original work in "acid_preds" focused on acid dose required to give a 25% reduction in emission relative to the untreated state. This was fine except for digestate, because the initial state was already much higher than untreated slurry.

2. For digestate, the "initial state" was therefore defined as untreated slurry, and therefore the target became a pH level of 6.6, because this is more-or-less the average pH that the other types of slurry had after an acid dose that gave a 25% reduction. So for digestate, the question became how much acid was required for a pH of 6.6? This could be determined soley from the titration curves. There were two possible ways of calculting this, and we opted for what is called "method 1" in the code. In that I first calculate an average titration curve for each animal type, and then interpolate to pH 6.6/6.0 for that single average. To work around the different pH ranges for each sample, I limited the curves to where all samples were present. So for digestate, slight extrapolation is required. These are, for each animal, the "dose that gives a mean pH of 6.0 or 6.6." For standard deviation, I estimated standard error with a bootstrap approach, and from that and n (number of samples), made some kind of standard deviation estimate. This all could be done differently, based on predicted emission.

3. Method 2 is different, and probably not useful. I interpolated each individual titration curve to pH 6.6/6.0, and then took the means of these values, ultimately by animal. So these are the "mean of all doses that individually give pH 6.0 or 6.6 for each sample". 

4. AP decided that stored slurrry should have an initial pH 0.6 units below the values we calculated as described above for field-applied, based on the highly variable responses seen in measurements over time. So that was taken as an average pH of 6.0 (not an average acid dose--presumably it is easier to determine pH than exact dose in a storage system with new slurry coming in all the time). Therefore I included pH 6.0 in the calculations described above for 2 and 3.
