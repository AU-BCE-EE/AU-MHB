# Manure titration

# Summary
These data were collected at Aarhus University in 2020.
This directory contains the data and R scripts for data processing.
Resulting output are (were) used in different ways to support emission factor calculations.

* `output/dpH_acid_doses.csv` contains mean change in pH (from un-acidified condition, i.e., at start of titration) for the acid doses required by regulation.
These are (kg 96% H2SO4 per ton (Mg) slurry):
        animal dose.kg.t
1     Afgasset      11.0
2         Kvæg       3.0
3   Slagtesvin       2.9
4 So-/smågrise       2.9
